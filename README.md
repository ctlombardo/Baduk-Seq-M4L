# Baduk-Seq-M4L
M4L version of my Baduk Sequencer. Has receiving devices for black and white piece triggers.

Click and drag to place a GO piece. Drag a little for black and more for white. 

Simply place the Black and White pieces on an empty MIDI track, and you'll receive a pulse of C3 each time a piece is a piece is triggered from the GoBoard.

Notes:
1- Often I seem to need to restart the Toggle box on the device after selecting the note division tempo from the menu.
2- I hope to get a more accurate position indicator in the future
3- While I handle #2 I'm planning on a selectable range of rows/columns.
4- If actually playing the Go Board you'll need to manually remove the stones. I don't have the math or programming skills to make a go piece disappear once captured.
5- This thing could theoretically be played like a Go Game.

Enjoy!
